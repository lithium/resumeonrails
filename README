## User Stories


As an Owner I can...
    update my skill set:
        - name ("programming knowledge", "management skills")
        - description (optional, likely bullet point summaries)

    update my work history:
        - company
        - position
        - start_date
        - end_date(optional)
        - address
        - contact info
        - description

    update my portfolio:
        - project name
        - language
        - description
        - screenshot (optional)
        - source links

    update landing pages:
        a landing page is an html bio section, with the ability to navigate within: Skill Set, Work History or Portfolio.
        a landing page is either public or has a "Resume Code": a short 4 digit alphanumeric code that can be easily given in emails so as to be kept private otherwise.
